                <h3>Kundalini Yoga</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Kundalini is all about awakening your kundalini energy, or shakti, which is the primal energy thought to sit at the base of the spine.

                    This is a more spiritual practice, and there will be more chanting, meditation, and breathing in this class than in others. 
                    This can be a little out there for the practitioner who doesn’t fully embrace the philosophy of shakti and all that comes with it. However, 
                    it can be fun for the person who wants to chant, learn mantras, and find out more about lesser known hatha practices, like mula bandha (“root lock”).
                </p>

            <div>
                <h3>Hatha</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Hatha yoga is the foundation for all yoga styles and refers to any practice that combines asana, pranayama, and meditation.

                    Typically, these classes have a slightly slower pace, but you can always ask the instructor how vigorous the flow is before 
                    jumping in. Since this type of yoga is the foundation for all yoga and tends to be a relaxing flow, hatha can be great for beginners or 
                    those wanting a more meditative or even restorative practice.

                <h3>Iyengar</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    This type of yoga was developed by B. K. S. Iyengar. This practice is all about balancing flexibility and strength through proper body alignment. 
                    Studios where it’s taught typically have a lot of props — blankets, blocks, straps, etc. — to help people of all ages, flexibilities, and abilities find 
                    alignment that is perfect for their bodies.

                    The poses are generally held longer, but the support of props and attention to alignment make this a great practice for those overcoming injury.

                <h3>Hot Yoga</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    As touched on above, not all hot yoga is Bikram yoga. Hot yoga can essentially be any type of yoga done in a heated room, typically between 95 and 100 degrees. 
                    In general, hot yoga classes are vinyasa classes held in heated rooms. These classes will, of course, cause practitioners to sweat a lot and can require breaks 
                    the first few classes, just like Bikram.

                    Your muscles are very warm in these classes, so they can be great for improving flexibility. However, you also want to be careful, as it can be easier to pull a 
                    muscle when your muscles are so much warmer than usual
