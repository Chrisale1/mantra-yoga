when testing for responsiviness in different devices. I had problems with the navigation links fiting into small mobile screen. So i had to reduce the margin from left from both the logo and navigation link.

Also on problems with fiting contents of the yoga techniques in the box when screen size is reduced so height of the div was increase.
